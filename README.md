# Analysis-of-Diabetes-in-Indian-Women
Analyzed the ‘National Family Health Survey-4’ data (binary data along with some covariates where response is binary and tells that whether a lady has diabetes or not) and visualize the respective results. Run Binary-Logistic regression on the data and tested HL-GOF goodness of fit criterion. Coding language and application that I used are- R, Excel.
